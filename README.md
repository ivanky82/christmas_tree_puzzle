# christmas_tree_puzzle
A simple python code to compute the number of solutions of the puzzle

There are two files in this project:
- solver.py contains all helper functions, currently consists of only one methods which is to compute the number of solutions given the equations
- main1.py is the main file that will call the function in solver.py in every loop
